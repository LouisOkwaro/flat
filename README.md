# Flataculties Code Challenge

## This is a project aiming to achieve the following deliverables as a user:

### Project Setup 
1. First start by running this command to get the backend started (json-server --watch db.json)
2. Then test your server by visiting this route in the browser; http://localhost:3000/characters
3. Then, open the index.html file on your browser to run the application.

### Deliverable 1
See a list of all animal names. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data

### Deliverable 2
Click on an animal’s name to see its details i.e image and number of votes. Note, you should only be displaying the details of one animal at a time. You can either use the character information from your first request or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details 

### Deliverable 3
When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.
